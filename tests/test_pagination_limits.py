"""
Pagination and safety cap tests for fetch_pr_comments.

Key changes vs. old debug_test.py:
- Converted ad-hoc debug print test into proper pytest tests.
- Use fixtures from tests/conftest.py (mock_http_client, create_mock_response).
- Use pytest.mark.parametrize to cover multiple max_pages values.
- Assert outcomes instead of printing, ensuring idempotent, side-effect-free runs.
