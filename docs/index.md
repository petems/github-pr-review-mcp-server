# GitHub PR Review MCP

Welcome to the documentation portal for the GitHub PR Review MCP server. This site consolidates onboarding, deployment, and reference material to help humans and MCP-compatible agents integrate the server safely and efficiently.

Use the navigation sidebar to explore focused guides:

- **Getting Started** provides quick installation tutorials using `uv`, pip, or container images.
- **Guides** walk through common agent integrations, remote hosting topologies, and operational checklists.
- **Reference** captures protocol tooling, CLI commands, environment variables, and API schemas.
- **Architecture** explains system design, data flow, and security guardrails.
- **Contributing** documents the development workflow and quality gates for maintainers.
- **Security** highlights mandatory safeguards, threat models, and limitations of automated PR implementation.

If you are new to MCP, start with [Getting Started](getting-started/quickstart.md) and [Concepts](architecture/overview.md) before configuring the server inside your agent environment.
